# Counter Game

An incremental clicker game where you count up to 100,000.

## ðŸš§ Under Construction

This project is currently in active development.

## What is this?

A browser-based incremental game that tracks your progress as you accumulate points. Buy counters that automatically increment your total, and watch your growth visualized in real-time charts.

### Features (WIP)
- Auto-incrementing counters with random fluctuation
- Real-time delta chart showing growth rate
- Progress bar tracking towards 100k goal
- Dynamic UI updates

## Tech Stack

- TypeScript
- Chart.js for data visualization
- Vanilla DOM manipulation

## Current State

The game logic is functional but the build setup is incomplete. You'll need to add a bundler (Vite/Webpack/Parcel) to compile and run the TypeScript code.
